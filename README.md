# Offboad-C++-code-controlling-drones-motion-simulated-in-PX4-Software-in-the-loop-simulation
First project of course ENAE788M used to simulate the PX4 autopilot framework using ROS Noetic, PX4 flight stack, jmavsim and an offboard C++ code

The simulation output videos have been divided in three segments due to size. The simulation outputs looks like as shown below:


## Startup of the jmavsim environment and takeoff:
